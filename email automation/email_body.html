                        <p>&emsp;In the past month, we have been working hard to bring NextGen BioTech to life. Now, we are thrilled to finally be able to share some updates about our journey as an association and the milestones we've achieved so far!<br/>
                        &emsp;For those of you who might not know us well yet, here's a little introduction: We are Carolina, Saraya, Sofia, Ardak, Raissa, Aibike, Evrim, and Ruti, 8 friends, all in the 2nd year of the Genomics program, united by a shared passion for science and a common vision to create a sense of belonging within our university.<br/>
                      &emsp;The idea to form this association grew from the feeling that something was missing: a space where students could connect, collaborate, and celebrate their shared interests beyond the classroom. So, we decided to take matters into our own hands and make it happen!</p>
                        <p><b>&emsp;The official beginning </b><br/>&emsp;Our association came to life on November 4th, 2024, when we held our first formal meeting. During this gathering, we voted on key positions, laid out our mission and vision, and worked on the foundational documents that would define us as a group.  </p>
                        <p><b>&emsp;What we've achieved so far</b><br/>
                        &emsp;In these weeks, we've made incredible progress in the bureaucracy needed to register us as an association; here's a recap of it:<br/>
                        &emsp;1. We've established our internal structure and clearly defined our domains of activity.<br/>
                        &emsp;2. We've created essential documents, including our <b>Founding Act</b> and the designation of board roles.<br/>
                        &emsp;3. We're finalizing our <b>Statute</b>, which will solidify the guiding principles of our association.<br/>
                        <i>&emsp;Currently, we're in the process of collecting the <b>100 signatures</b> needed to register officially as an association. Out of our 150 members, we've collected around 50 signatures so far. While this is a great start, we still have some work to do!</i></p>
                        <p>&emsp;<b>Why is registration so important?</b><br/>  &emsp;Official registration will grant us access to resources needed to organize events, workshops, and initiatives that truly make a difference for all of us. Every signature counts, and your support means the world to us!</p>
                        <p style="color:#fa8e73">&emsp;<b>If you're already a member and haven't had the chance to sign yet, please consider helping us cross this important milestone. And if you know someone who shares our passion for science and could be part of the community, invite them to join us! Together, we're building something amazing!</b></p>

                <img src ="cid:book" alt="book"  style="width:200px;height:300px"></center>
                <p>&emsp;I'm excited to break the ice and bring you the first recommendation! The book I've been absolutely hooked on this past month is <b>'The Song of the Cell'</b> by <i>Pulitzer Prize-winning</i> author <b>Siddhartha Mukherjee</b>. It's been my go-to companion on these cold, rainy November nights—perfect for curling up in bed after a long day.</p>
                <p>&emsp;This captivating read takes you on a journey through groundbreaking discoveries in the molecular world. Each chapter dives into a new scientific milestone, blending the history of these achievements with Mukherjee's heartfelt anecdotes from his life as a doctor and researcher. What makes it truly special is how the author breaks down complex biological concepts into engaging, story-like narratives that anyone can enjoy.</p>
                <p>&emsp;I particularly loved the first part of the book, which beautifully traces the history of the cell's discovery. For the first time, I felt like I had a complete picture of the timeline—it’s both enlightening and inspiring. </p>
                <p>&emsp;This book is also perfect for the busy school season. With each chapter taking less than an hour to read, it’s easy to squeeze into a packed schedule, leaving you feeling enriched. If you’re looking for a book that’s as educational as it is enjoyable, this is it!</p>
